# [B. NUMGUESS - Guess the Number](https://www.spoj.com/problems/NUMGUESS/en/)

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Just a simple binary search.
Scan $a$ and $b$ first. Set $a$ and $b$ as lower limit and upper limit of binary search respectively. Then keep guessing until the guess is correct.

This will gurantee the minimum number of guesses.

Note: Don't forget to flush the bffer after each guess.
